        2009–2015: World record transfer and consecutive Ballon d'Or wins
        
        Ronaldo adapted tremendously to Spanish football, scoring 33 goals in just 35 games in his debut season.
        In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million.[90] At least 80,000 fans attended his
        presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at
        Napoli.[91] Ronaldo said, "This is the completion of my boyhood dream, to be a Real Madrid player."[92]
